# GetFocus Assignment

### Jupyter Notebook Installation
If Jupyter Notebook is not installed, please install it using the guide here: https://jupyter.org/install.

### Clone the github repository
Clone the repo using ```git clone https://github.com/novojitsaha/getfocus_assignment.git```.

### Creating necesssary folders.
You may name the name the folders as you wish, but then you have to change the directories in the code as well. To keep it easy, create the following 3 folders: `data`, `output_data`, and `embeddings`.

#### Data Folders
Copy the `case_data.json` in the data folder if you want to run `preprocess_data.ipynb`. Any output files generated by this file will be written inside the `output_data` directory.

#### Embeddings Folders
To save time and resources, I pre-computed the embeddings and uploaded it to google drive. You can download them here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kvGaMN9NLZRh2ECsZIyD4yJcTr8TNBG_?usp=drive_link. Copy the embeddings to the `embeddings` folder.

### Running the project files
Open Jupyter Notebook in the project directory. Here's a guide on how to run Jupyter Notebook: https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html#basic-steps.
